# Domains

## Selected domains are bolded\*\*

1. **Video games: Playing video games, by myself and with friends.**

   Since I was a child, I loved to play video games. These include fighting games (Street Fighter, Smash Bros.), sandbox games (Minecraft, Terraria), and platformers (Mario, Kirby). I also love to replay and complete retro games as fast as possible. My taste in gaming genres is pretty selective, but if a friend recommends a game for me to play, then I will give it a try with them.

2. Watching YouTube: Gameplay videos, funny shorts, educational content

3. **Traveling: International trips, vacations, exploring**

   I like traveling to new faraway places. With my family, I have visited Toronto, the Bahamas, and multiple prefectures of Japan. Planning these trips is a lot of work but very fulfilling for me. Deciding what places to visit, what restaurants to eat at, and learning how to navigate cities isdom a highlight of the traveling experience. I wish to visit someplace in Europe next, but I feel like not knowing certain languages is a barrier I need to overcome.

4. Food: Trying new cultural foods, learning to cook new meals

5. Taking walks: Long walks near home for relaxation and exercise

6. Coding projects: Software projects for clubs and professional development

7. Media creation: Photoshop, creating videos about my life and educational content

8. Learning languages: Taking language classes, using Duolingo, practicing with a fluent speaker

9. Practicing self-care: Knowing when to sleep, take breaks, eating healthy

10. **Outside class work: Working on homework and projects, studying for exams**

    As an MIT student, I am constantly doing work outside of the classroom. I double check my schedule every day to determine multiple things: when do I complete my assignments, when do I go to office hours, and when do I start studying for exams. Managing and scheduling all of this work is currently a big part of my current life, so I am interested in seeing if I can tackle a problem associated with my workload.
