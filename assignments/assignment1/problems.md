# Problems for selected domains

## Selected problems are bolded

1. Video games:

- **Finding communities: finding small gaming clubs and people with same gaming interests**

  My friend group likes a bunch of games that I am not too interested in, and vice versa. Though I still enjoy playing all games with them, I always think it would be really nice to find others who are passionate about the same games that I am. Though online communities for games do exist, these communities tend to be very large and it can be overwhelming befriending people there. I think an app that searches for gaming communities in a much smaller scale would make people more comfortable with finding potential gaming buddies.

- Health risks: Addiction, eye strain, hand strain

  Reason for exclusion: There are already many built-in features on gaming systems to prevent excessive playtime. These can be found in parental controls or just simple reminders to take a break. I believe that there are not many additional measures that can be taken to prevent this problem beyond the aforementioned features.

- Technical issues: Internet issues, outdated hardware, crossplay between systems

  Reason for exclusion: Many technical issues that arise from gaming could be solved by getting better hardware, such as a better computer or better internet. For software issues, you can troubleshoot online and find numerous solutions that go beyond the scope of a single software application.

2. Traveling:

- **Navigating new areas: Learning how to use transit systems, using foreign currency, learning etiquette and culture**

  Physical travel guides frequently contain outdated information. In my experience, their features have since been separated into multiple apps, such as an app just for finding rooms, and an app just for transit. I think an online touring application that combines these features would be a better way for people, especially newcomers to navigate places they visit. Using user feedback, the app could be continously updated with accurate information.

- Budgeting: Easy to overspend on vacations, planning budget on hotels, food, etc.

  Reason for exclusion: There are already apps that help solve these problems, like apps that point you to good deals for hotels and restaurants, and apps that track and notify your spending habits.

- Unpredictable circumstances: Bad weather can cancel events, getting sick

  Reason for exclusion: As the name implies, these events are unpredictable, especially if trips are planned well in advance. When they do happen, a simple web search can give you a list of alternative activities to pursue, and guidelines on how to seek treatment, respectively.

3. Outside class work:

- **Time management: Scheduling hours, procrastination, multi-tasking**

  As someone who has repeatedly had issues with time management, I have often heard the advice that you should schedule not just your work, but your everyday routine, including eating, sleeping, and downtime. However, I find scheduling all of this to be daunting. The timing of my activities in my daily routine changes all the time, so it would be difficult for me to come up with a schedule on my own. I think an app that can generate a weekly schedule for me would be a great first step in improving time management skills.

- Bad mental health: Stress and burnout, discouragement in doing work

  Reason for exclusion: For my case, if I am struggling with my mental health relating to my schoolwork, I know the resources that I can access that are provided to me by my classes and by the school. I imagine that students in other universities have their own support network, which a general application may be unaware of.

- Bad collaboration: Partners don't show up to meetings, unequal effort, disagreements over problem solving

  Reason for exclusion: In my opinion, unless it's to verify a proposition, I don't believe a software application can fix bad teamwork any better than personal confrontation. I do believe that an app to find good teammates with similar work times and ethics is a good idea, however this has already been accomplished here with pset partners.
