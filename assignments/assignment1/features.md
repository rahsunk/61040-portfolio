# Stakeholders:

1. Video games: Finding communities

   - Consumers: Gamers interested in finding friends and communities relating to the game
   - Outside friends: Friends that the consumers already have
   - Game developers: The people who create the games

Impacts:

Consumers and outside friends may suffer from not sharing a connection through a game that one of them enjoys. Outside friends would be interested in what new friends the consumer is making through gaming. Developers would be interested in what communities like their games.

2. Traveling: Navigating new areas

   - Tourists: People traveling to a place for the first time
   - Reviewers: People who have already traveled to a place and have insight about it
   - Local citizens: People who live in the areas that tourists visit

Impacts:

Tourists would have difficulty navigating a place without a good guide. Local citizens could be burdened by tourists not knowing proper etiquette. They would also be interested in whether online information about their home is accurate. Reviewers would want tourists to have a better experience by giving them anecdotes of their own experience.

3. Outside class work: Time management

   - Users: People seeking to improve their time management
   - Friends: Friends of users whose daily routine can affect the schedule of users and vice versa
   - Event organizers: People who schedule continuous events that users attend, such as classes, work hours, and club meetings

Impacts:

Event organizers can be burdened by users with bad time management skills if they don't attend their events. A friend asking a user for free time (and vice versa) can complicate the other stakeholder's routine. Users, friends, and event organizers could all benefit from proper communication about their availability.
