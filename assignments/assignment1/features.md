# Features:

1. Video games: Finding communities
   - Map search: By allowing permission to access your location, you can find other nearby users who are interested in the same game as you.
   - Chatting: Send direct messages to people you meet through the app to get to know them better and discuss when to play with them.
   - Gaming interests: In your profile, list the games you are interested in, and possibly some additional information about your playstyle so that others with similar interests may reach out to you.
2. Traveling: Navigating new areas
   - User feedback: For a specific area, users (reviewers) can make a comment about what other features they would like to see be added, and correct any information that may be incorrect or outdated. Admins can then modify the app to take into account this feedback to improve the consumer experience.
   - Transit Guide: Not a Google Maps clone, but a beginners' guide on using the transit system that includes a map, schedule, and fare information. New tourists can use this in tandem with their Maps app to easily use the transit system for the first time.
   - Culture Guide: A guide on etiquette, manners, and cultural guidelines for users. This not only improves the experience of tourists but it also helps to not disturb local citizens.
3. Outside class work: Time management
   - Preference Form: A form of questions users can answer to help generate a schedule for them.
   - Reminders: Notifications sent to users' phones to notify them a planned event in their schedule is about to start. Helps the user stick to their created schedule.
   - To-do list: A list of responsibilities that the user has alongside their deadlines, periodically reminding the user of what tasks they need to complete
   - Sharing schedules: Share your schedules with other users and non-users. This can inspire friends to create their own schedule and you can let others like your supervisors know when you plan to work and have free time.
