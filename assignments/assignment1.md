# Assignment 1

### Domains

**Selected domains are bolded**

1. **Video games: Playing video games, by myself and with friends.**

   Since I was a child, I loved to play video games. These include fighting games (Street Fighter, Smash Bros.), sandbox games (Minecraft, Terraria), and platformers (Mario, Kirby). I also love to replay and complete retro games as fast as possible. My taste in gaming genres is pretty selective, but if a friend recommends a game for me to play, then I will give it a try with them.

2. Watching YouTube: Gameplay videos, funny shorts, educational content

3. **Traveling: International trips, vacations, exploring**

   I like traveling to new faraway places. With my family, I have visited Toronto, the Bahamas, and multiple prefectures of Japan. Planning these trips is a lot of work but very fulfilling for me. Deciding what places to visit, what restaurants to eat at, and learning how to navigate cities isdom a highlight of the traveling experience. I wish to visit someplace in Europe next, but I feel like not knowing certain languages is a barrier I need to overcome.

4. Food: Trying new cultural foods, learning to cook new meals

5. Taking walks: Long walks near home for relaxation and exercise

6. Coding projects: Software projects for clubs and professional development

7. Media creation: Photoshop, creating videos about my life and educational content

8. Learning languages: Taking language classes, using Duolingo, practicing with a fluent speaker

9. Practicing self-care: Knowing when to sleep, take breaks, eating healthy

10. **Outside class work: Working on homework and projects, studying for exams**

    As an MIT student, I am constantly doing work outside of the classroom. I double check my schedule every day to determine multiple things: when do I complete my assignments, when do I go to office hours, and when do I start studying for exams. Managing and scheduling all of this work is currently a big part of my current life, so I am interested in seeing if I can tackle a problem associated with my workload.

### Problems for selected domains

**Selected problems are bolded**

1. Video games:
   (Used ChatGPT to generate a list of problems associated with this domain; explanations provided by myself)

- **Finding communities: finding small gaming clubs, finding people with same gaming interests**

  My friend group likes a bunch of games that I am not too interested in, and vice versa. Though I still enjoy playing all games with them, I always think it would be really nice to find others who are passionate about the same games that I am. Though online communities for games exist everywhere, these communities tend to be very large and it can be overwhelming befriending people there. I think an app that searches for gaming communities in a much smaller scale would make people more comfortable with finding gaming buddies.

- Health risks: Addiction, eye strain, hand strain

  Reason for exclusion: There are already many built-in features on gaming systems to prevent excessive playtime. These can be found in parental controls or just simple reminders to take a break. I believe that there are not many additional measures that can be taken to prevent this problem beyond the aforementioned features.

- Technical issues: Internet issues, outdated hardware, crossplay between systems

  Reason for exclusion: Most technical issues that arise from gaming could be solved by getting better hardware, such as a better computer, better internet, or troubleshooting online. These solutions are beyond the scope of a single software application.

2. Traveling:

- **Navigating new areas: Learning how to use transit systems, using foreign currency, learning etiquette and culture**

  Physical travel guides frequently contain outdated information, and in my experience, their features have been separated into multiple apps, such as an app just for finding rooms, and an app just for transit. I think an online app with continuously updated information from user feedback would be a better way for people, especially newcomers to navigate places they visit.

- Budgeting: Easy to overspend on vacations, planning budget on hotels, food, etc.

  Reason for exclusion: There are already apps that help solve these problems, like apps that point you to good deals for hotels and restaurants, and apps that track and notify your spending habits.

- Unpredictable circumstances: Bad weather can cancel events, getting sick

  Reason for exclusion: As the name implies, these events are unpredictable, especially if trips are planned well in advance. When they do happen, a simple web search can give you a list of alternative activities to pursue, and guidelines on how to seek treatment, respectively.

3. Outside class work:

- **Time management: Scheduling hours, procrastination, multi-tasking**

  As someone who has repeatedly had issues with time management, I have often heard the advice that you should schedule not just your work, but your everyday routine, including eating, sleeping, and downtime. However, I find scheduling all of this to be daunting. The timing of my activities in my daily routine changes all the time, so it would be difficult for me to come up with a schedule on my own. I think an app that can generate a weekly schedule for me would be a great first step in improving time management skills.

- Bad mental health: Stress and burnout, discouraged from trying

  Reason for exclusion: For my case, if I am struggling with my mental health relating to my schoolwork, I know the resources that I can access that are provided to me by my classes and by the school. I imagine that students in other universities have their own support network, which an application may be unaware of.

- Bad collaboration: Partners don't show up to meetings, unequal effort, disagreements over problem solving

  Reason for exclusion: In my opinion, unless it's to verify a proposition, I don't believe a software application can fix bad teamwork any better than personal confrontation. Though I think an app to find good teammates with similar work times and ethics is a good idea, I know that this has already been accomplished here with psetpartners.

### Stakeholders:

1. Video games: Finding communities

   - Consumers: Gamers interested in finding friends and communities relating to the game
   - Outside friends: Friends consumers already have
   - Game developers: The people who create the games

   Impacts:

   Consumers and outside friends may suffer from not sharing a connection through a game one of them enjoys. Outside friends would be interested in what new friends the consumer is making through the app. Developers would be interested in what communities like their games.

2. Traveling: Navigating new areas

   - Tourists: People traveling to a place and potential users of the app
   - Reviewers: Users of the app who can provide feedback to improve it
   - Local citizens: People who live in the areas that tourists visit

   Impacts:

   Tourists would have difficulty navigating a place without a good guide. Local citizens could be burdened by tourists not knowing proper etiquette. They would also be interested if the information on the app about their home is accurate. Reviewers would want tourists to have a better experience by giving them anecdotes of their own experience using the app.

3. Outside class work: Time management

   - Users: People seeking to improve their time management
   - Friends: Friends of users whose daily routine can affect the schedule of users and vice versa
   - Event organizers: People who schedule continuous events that users attend, such as classes, work hours, and club meetings

   Impacts:

   Event organizers can be burdened by users with bad time management skills if they don't attend their events. A friend asking a user for free time (and vice versa) can complicate the other stakeholder's routine. Users, friends, and event organizers could all benefit from proper communication about their availability.

### Features:

1. Video games: Finding communities
   - Map search: By allowing permission to access your location, you can find other nearby users who are interested in the same game as you.
   - Chatting: Send direct messages to people you meet through the app to get to know them better and discuss when to play with them.
   - Gaming interests: In your profile, list the games you are interested in, and possibly some additional information about your playstyle so that others with similar interests may reach out to you.
2. Traveling: Navigating new areas
   - User feedback: For a specific area, users (reviewers) can make a comment about what other features they would like to see be added, and correct any information that may be incorrect or outdated. Admins can then modify the app to take into account this feedback to improve the consumer experience.
   - Transit Guide: Not a Google Maps clone, but a beginners' guide on using the transit system that includes a map, schedule, and fare information. New tourists can use this in tandem with their Maps app to easily use the transit system for the first time.
   - Culture Guide: A guide on etiquette, manners, and cultural guidelines for users. This not only improves the experience of tourists but it also helps to not disturb local citizens.
3. Outside class work: Time management
   - Preference Form: A form of questions users can answer to help generate a schedule for them.
   - Reminders: Notifications sent to users' phones to notify them a planned event in their schedule is about to start. Helps the user stick to their created schedule.
   - To-do list: A list of responsibilities that the user has alongside their deadlines, periodically reminding the user of what tasks they need to complete
   - Sharing schedules: Share your schedules with other users and non-users. This can inspire friends to create their own schedule and you can let others like your supervisors know when you plan to work and have free time.
