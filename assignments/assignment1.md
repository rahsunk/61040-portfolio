# Assignment 1

### Domains

**Selected domains are bolded**

1. **Video games: Playing video games, by myself and with friends.**

   Since I was a child, I loved to play video games. These include fighting games (Street Fighter, Smash Bros.), sandbox games (Minecraft, Terraria), and platformers (Mario, Kirby). I also love to replay and complete retro games as fast as possible. My taste in gaming genres is pretty selective, but if a friend recommends a game for me to play, then I will give it a try with them.

2. Watching YouTube: Gameplay videos, funny shorts, educational content

3. **Traveling: International trips, vacations, exploring**

   I like traveling to new faraway places. With my family, I have visited Toronto, the Bahamas, and multiple prefectures of Japan. Planning these trips is a lot of work but very fulfilling for me. Deciding what places to visit, what restaurants to eat at, and learning how to navigate cities is a highlight of the traveling experience. I wish to visit someplace in Europe next, but I feel like not knowing certain languages is a barrier I need to overcome.

4. Food: Trying new cultural foods, learning to cook new meals

5. Taking walks: Long walks near home for relaxation and exercise

6. Coding projects: Software projects for clubs and professional development

7. Media creation: Photoshop, creating videos about my life and educational content

8. Learning languages: Taking language classes, using Duolingo, practicing with a fluent speaker

9. Practicing self-care: Knowing when to sleep, take breaks, eating healthy

10. **Outside class work: Working on homework and projects, studying for exams**

    As an MIT student, I am constantly doing work outside of the classroom. I double check my schedule every day to determine multiple things: when do I complete my assignments, when do I go to office hours, and when do I start studying for exams. Managing and scheduling all of this work is currently a big part of my current life, so I am interested in seeing if I can tackle a problem associated with my workload.

### Problems for selected domains

**Selected problems are bolded**

1. Video games:
   (Used ChatGPT to generate a list of problems associated with this domain; explanations provided by myself)

- **Technical issues: Internet issues, outdated hardware, crossplay between systems**

  **Guide on hardware compatibility for gaming**

  In the modern day, there are many things you need to research about before playing a new game. Does the game work without internet? Does the game allow crossplay (gameplay between different systems)? Does the game allow local and online multiplayer? What are the minimum specs needed to play the game? Sometimes finding this information can be difficult, especially if it's a game that has recently been released. I think an online respository that tracks this information would be an easy way for gamers to make sure that they have the correct setup to play the game by themselves and with others.

- Health risks: Addiction, eye strain, hand strain

  Reason for exclusion: There are already many built-in features on gaming systems to prevent excessive playtime. These can be found in parental controls or just simple reminders to take a break. I believe that there are not many additional measures that can be taken to prevent this problem beyond the aforementioned features.

- Feeling anger: Frustration at not playing well, arguments between friends over playstyle, competition being too fierce

  Reason for exclusion: I don't believe that an app here is a good way to mitigate emotional challenges like these. I think using an app here would be an example of antibodies from Lecture 1, where users (especially friends) would reject the idea that they need software to fix personal conflicts.

2. Traveling:

- **Navigating new areas: Learning how to use transit systems, using foreign currency, learning etiquette and culture**

  **Online travel guide**

  Physical travel guides frequently contain outdated information, and in my experience, their features have been separated into multiple apps, such as an app just for finding rooms, and an app just for transit. I think an online app with continously updated information from user feedback would be a better way for people, especially newcomers to navigate places they visit. I believe that information on how to use transit systems (fare, train schedule) and foreign currency, which are often omitted in preexisting apps, would be a great feature to include in this app.

- Budgeting: Easy to overspend on vacations, planning budget on hotels, food, etc.

  Reason for exclusion: There are already apps that help solve these problems, like apps that point you to good deals for hotels and restaurants, and apps that track and notify your spending habits.

- Unpredictable circumstances: Bad weather can cancel events, getting sick

  Reason for exclusion: As the name implies, these events are unpredictable, especially if trips are planned well in advance. When they do happen, a simple web search can give you a list of alternative activities to pursue, and guidelines on how to seek treatment, respectively.

3. Outside class work:

- **Time Management: Scheduling hours, procrastination, multi-tasking**

  **Customizable schedule generator**

  As someone who has repeatedly had issues with time management, I have often heard the advice that you should schedule not just your work, but your everyday routine, including eating, sleeping, and downtime. However, I find scheduling all of this to be daunting. The timing of my activities in my daily routine changes all the time, so it would be difficult for me to come up with a schedule on my own. I think an app that can generate a weekly schedule with reminders would resolve this first step and get me to improve my time management. I imagine this can be done by the app asking me about my weekly responsibilities and a few questions about my preferences in my daily life.

- Mental Health: Stress and burnout, discouraged from trying

  Reason for exclusion: For my case, if I am struggling with my mental health relating to my schoolwork, I know the resources that I can access that are provided to me by my classes and by the school. I imagine that students in other universities have their own support network, which an application may be unaware of.

- Bad Collaboration: Partners don't show up to meetings, unequal effort, disagreements over problem solving

  Reason for exclusion: In my opinion, unless it's to verify a proposition, I don't believe a software application can fix bad teamwork any better than personal confrontation. Though I think an app to find good teammates with similar work times and ethics is a good idea, I know that this has already been accomplished here with psetpartners.
