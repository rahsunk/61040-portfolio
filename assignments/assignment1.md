# Assignment 1

### Domains

**Selected domains are highlighted**

1. ==Video games: Playing video games, by myself and with friends.==
   Since I was a child, I loved to play video games. These include fighting games (Street Fighter, Smash Bros.), sandbox games (Minecraft, Terraria), and platformers (Mario, Kirby). I also love to replay and complete retro games as fast as possible. My taste in gaming genres is pretty selective, but if a friend recommends a game for me to play, then I will give it a try with them.

2. Watching YouTube: Gameplay videos, funny shorts, educational content

3. ==Traveling: International trips, vacations, exploring==
   I like traveling to new faraway places. With my family, I have visited Toronto, the Bahamas, and multiple prefectures of Japan. Planning these trips is a lot of work but very fulfilling for me. Deciding what places to visit, what restaurants to eat at, and learning how to navigate cities is a highlight of the traveling experience. I wish to visit someplace in Europe next, but I feel like not knowing certain languages is a barrier I need to overcome.

4. Food: Trying new cultural foods, learning to cook new meals

5. Taking walks: Long walks near home for relaxation and exercise

6. Coding projects: Software projects for clubs and professional development

7. Media creation: Photoshop, creating videos about my life and educational content

8. Learning languages: Taking language classes, using Duolingo, practicing with a fluent speaker

9. Practicing self-care: Knowing when to sleep, take breaks, eating healthy

10. ==Outside class work: Working on homework and projects, studying for exams==
    As an MIT student, I am constantly doing work outside of the classroom. I double check my schedule every day to determine multiple things: when do I complete my assignments, when do I go to office hours, and when do I start studying for exams. Managing and scheduling all of this work is currently a big part of my current life, so I am interested in seeing if I can tackle a problem associated with my workload.

### Problems for selected domains

**Selected problems are highlighted**

1. Video games:
   (Used ChatGPT to generate a list of problems associated with this domain; explanations provided by myself)

- Hardware issues: Internet issues, outdated hardware, crossplay between systems

- Health risks: Addiction, eye strain, hand strain
  Reason for exclusion: There are already many built-in features on gaming systems to prevent excessive playtime. These can be found in parental controls or just simple reminders to take a break. I believe that there are not many additional measures that can be taken to prevent this problem beyond the aforementioned features.

- Feeling anger: Frustration at not playing well, arguments between friends over playstyle, competition being too fierce
  Reason for exclusion: I don't believe that an app here is a good way to mitigate emotional challenges like these. I think using an app here would be an example of antibodies from Lecture 1, where users (especially friends) would reject the idea that they need software to fix personal conflicts.

2. Traveling:

- Navigating new areas: Learning how to use transit systems, using foreign currency, learning etiquette and culture

- Budgeting: Easy to overspend on vacations, planning budget on hotels, food, etc.
  Reason for exclusion: There are already apps that help solve these problems, like apps that point you to good deals for hotels and restaurants, and apps that track and notify your spending habits.

- Unpredictable circumstances: Bad weather can cancel events, getting sick
  Reason for exclusion: As the name implies, these events are unpredictable, especially if trips are planned well in advance. When they do happen, a simple web search can give you a list of alternative activities to pursue, and guidelines on how to seek treatment, respectively.
