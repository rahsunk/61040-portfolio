# Problem Statement

### Problem Domain:

**Outside class work**

As an MIT student, I am constantly doing work outside of the classroom. I double-check my schedule every day to determine multiple things: when I complete my assignments, when I go to office hours, and when I start studying for exams. Managing and scheduling all of this work is currently a big part of the lives of myself and my peers, so I am interested in seeing if I can tackle a problem associated with MIT workloads that could potentially be used by other students as well.

### Problem:

**Task management**

As a result of the fast-paced nature of classes, jobs, and extracurricular activities that university students have, they often struggle with task management. In addition to finding a good time and order to attend to these responsibilities, they would have to allocate time for homework, eating, sleeping, and downtime. Managing all of these tasks is daunting, and with activities in students' daily routine changing all the time from the aforementioned circumstances, it can be very difficult for them to create a schedule by themselves.

### Stakeholder List:

- Students: Main group of people who bear the problem, they wish to improve their task management
- Friends of Students: Friends of users whose daily routine can affect the schedule of users and vice versa; they could mutually benefit with students from proper communication about their availability.
- Professors, TAs: Involved in scheduling classes, review sessions, and exams, which heavily influence the schedules of students; they would want high attendance in classes and for students to attend exams with as few conflicts as possible
- Job supervisors + Club organizers: Involved in scheduling meeting hours and deliverable deadlines, but more flexible to change compared to classes; they would be burdened by absent workers/club members with poor task management skills

### Evidence and Comparables:

- [Unlocking academic success (Evidence)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11967054/): This study found that students who have better time management have better study habits and are less prone to distractions like phone usage. For young adults (university students), learning self-control is a very important skill for their future, and the article illustrates a major reason why task management is so important to them.
- [Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students (Evidence)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9169886): Much of the stress within students is caused by the heavy load of academics, which, if severe, can cause cognitive damage and chronic physical conditions. The study found that proper time management and goal setting reduce this stress, highlighting their importance to university students.
- Observation: I have witnessed many MIT students stop going to lectures and club meetings halfway through a semester as a result of their heavy workload. Many of these absences were unannounced, and in some cases, students would agree to attend an event but not show up. These occurrences indicate that time and task management is an issue for MIT students and that the lack of communication with event organizers is prevalent.
- [Todoist (Comparable)](https://www.todoist.com/): Popular task manager available on desktop and mobile that allows users to keep track of both individual and team tasks, and organize them with labels and priority assignments. Provides a simple user interface, but locks many important features like reminders behind an expensive paywall, which students typically do not have the money for. It also does not have automatically updated calendars; changes made to schedules must be made manually.
- [Timetree (Comparable)](https://timetreeapp.com/intl/en): An app that allows you to share schedules with others and communicate with others using the shared calendar. It is great for allowing users to have a synced schedule through dynamically updated calendars, but it includes obstructive ads in the free version and locks priority assignments for tasks behind a paywall, making it difficult for students to find a order to do their tasks.
