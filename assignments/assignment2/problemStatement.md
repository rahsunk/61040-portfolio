# Problem Statement

## Problem Domain:

**Outside class work**

As an MIT student, I am constantly doing work outside of the classroom. I double-check my schedule every day to determine multiple things: when I complete my assignments, when I go to office hours, and when I start studying for exams. Managing and scheduling all of this work is currently a big part of the lives of myself and my peers, so I am interested in seeing if I can tackle a problem associated with MIT workloads that could potentially be used by other students as well.

## Problem:

**Task management**

As a result of the fast-paced nature of classes, jobs, and extracurricular activities that university students have, they often struggle with task management. In addion to maintaining a calendar with all of these tasks, there are also non-repeating events like one-time dormspam events and group study sessions that students have to schedule. Furthermore students may wish to schedule time for themselves to work on homework, eat, sleep, and have downtime, but they may struggle to prioritize these tasks and order them in their schedule.Managing all of these tasks is daunting and with activities in students' daily routine changing all the time from the aforementioned circumstances, it can be very difficult creating a schedule by themselves.

## Stakeholder List:

- Students: Main group of people who bear the problem, they wish to improve their task management
- Friends of Students: Friends of users whose daily routine can affect the schedule of users and vice versa; could mutually benefit with students from proper communication about their availability.
- Professors, TAs: Involved in scheduling classes, review sessions, and exams, which heavily influence the schedules of students; they would want high attendance in classes and for students to attend exams with as little conflicts as possible
- Job supervisors + Club organizers: Involved in scheduling meeting hours and deliverable deadlines, but more flexible to change compared to classes; they would be burdened by absent workers/club members with poor task management skills
