# Application Pitch

## Task-mate

### Motivation

Due to the large amount of responsibilities and activities that university students often have on a daily basis, they often struggle with scheduling the time to work on their tasks and abiding by them, leading to stress, procrastination, and missed events. Task-mate aims to solve this problem by automatically generating schedules for students to meet their needs and to incentivize them to keep following them.

### Key Features

1. Automatic task scheduler
   - Given a collection of weekly events (classes, work, clubs) and tasks (homework, projects), Task-mate will automatically generate times in your schedule to work on these tasks, subject to given preference and priority constraints. This significantly reduces the time students take to figure out when they should complete their tasks, and gives them a good starting point to effective task and time management that professors/TAs, and other event organizers are looking for.
2. Daily Progress Report
   - Every day at some time, Task-mate will ask the user to report their progress on all of their tasks. Doing so causes Task-mate to update the students' generated schedule to give more or less time to certain tasks. This feature helps students resolve unexpected changes in their schedule, which in university happens all the time.
3. Sharing events with other users
   - Task-mate gives the ability to share events with other users. Users can accept or reject these shared events and request new times for them. This feature can assist in letting others, like your friends and supervisors, know when you have time to meet up with them for a group project.
